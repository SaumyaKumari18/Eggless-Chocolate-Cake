# EGGLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE #

## Step 1 ##

*Preheat the oven*

Preheat the oven to 170C or 340F for at least 15 mins. Grease a 8 inch round cake pan. I highly suggest to use parchment paper to line the cake tray. This way the eggless chocolate cake comes out of the pan easily .



If you do not have it, then drizzle some flour all over on the sides and bottom. Invert it & pat it off over the kitchen sink to remove the excess flour.

## Step 2 ##

*Prepare dry ingredients*

Place a sieve over a large mixing bowl. Add:

1 and a half cups all-purpose flour(180 grams)

One by four cup of cocoa powder

Half teaspoon of salt

1 teaspoon of baking soda

1 cup of powdered sugar

Before measuring flour & cocoa from the pack, fluff them up with a fork. Then spoon then to the measuring cup and level it with a straight edged knife or object. This way you will get the right amounts.

## Step 3 ##

*Mixing*

Mix then gently. Then sieve them together twice. This aerates the flour and makes the cake light.

## Step 4 ##

*Adding liquid*

Make space for the liquid ingredients in the center.

## Step 5 ##

*Mixing dry and wet ingredients*

Pour:

1 cup of water

1 tablespoon vanilla extract

1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar

one-third of oil (80 ml)

## Step 6 

*Mixing*

Mix all the ingredients well.

## Step 7

*Baking eggless chocolate cake*

Pour the cake batter to the pan. Knock it 2-3 times. Now, bake it in the preheated oven for 25 to 28 mins. Check after 25 mins. The timings may vary depending on the oven. So bake until the skewer inserted comes out clean.

## Step 8 ##

*Taking out the cake*

Allow it to cool down for 8 to 10 mins. After cooling invert it on a  cake rack. Remove the parchment paper. Cool it completely. If you prefer to frost you can do a chocolate frosting or you can dust some powdered sugar and some sprinkles.
